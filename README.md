This repository stores the codes and assignemnts completed within the cv course. 

## The 2th Week Assignment
1. To code a median filtering function instead of using cv2.medianBlur API in Python. To try to implement the function with a faster method than bacis method.
2. To write a pseudo code for RANSAC algorithm.

Description of the week2_assignment.py: the time consumings of two different median blur algorithms can be obtained from the output. Some experiment results are shown below.
